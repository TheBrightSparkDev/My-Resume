# my resume project 

this website is going to be my temporary resume that I will likely build upon to create something much more exciting and upto date. I will use this as it's meant to be used and that 's to create a website and to learn from the experience. My goal is to create little changes here and there as I go along and document why I've decided upon that design. 

## my creation diary 

### project start date 28/10/2021 

#### todays goal
Todays goal is to get through three lessons I am yet to begin and don't know what to expect in terms of video length details covered in each lesson and if it's even realistic to complete in a short time. I just want to start by building good habits and making sure I $ git commit at the end! 

had a real nightmare adding fontawesome seems like you need to sign up... 

so end of the day added a profile image and setup basic file best practices now to add commit push 

### day 2 of project building date 29/10/2021

#### todays goal

Today I want to complete the header of the website I've done what I would consider the hard part which was all the tedious set ups and getting the fonts and creating the files. The goal now is to start creating a header to be proud of.

so these last two days mustve been bad days for github because both days port 8000 stopped working so was forced to copy paste all code into adobe dreaweaver and use that to display a preview. Tried looking for a way around doing that but didnt get much luck sadly. adding committing and pushing now as its late.

### day 3 of project building date 31/10/2021

#### todays goal

Today I want to complete the header and the footer and start creating the content inbetween.

Success the stars must've aligned no problems with previews or systems today plain sailing all the way got lots done started by finishing the header added the footer and completed all links and finally almost finished the resume page flew through it all happy with todays progress. Only issue is it's 2am and I've got to be up for work at 7 i'll take it easy tomorrow...

### day 4 of project buidling

#### todays goal

Today I plan to finish the resume page small achievable goal. Am a little tired from last nights late night coding session progress stops for noone they say...
