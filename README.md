# my resume project 

this website is going to be my temporary resume that I will likely build upon to create something much more exciting and upto date. I will use this as it's meant to be used and that 's to create a website and to learn from the experience. My goal is to create little changes here and there as I go along and document why I've decided upon that design.

### project start date 29/10/2021 

#### todays goal
Todays goal is to get through three lessons I am yet to begin and don't know what to expect in terms of video length details covered in each lesson and if it's even realistic to complete in a short time. I just want to start by building good habits and making sure I $ git commit at the end!
